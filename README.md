Easy YUI
=======

This is a simple project to make YUI be a easy javascript library.
YUI is so big that is harder to be learned by a beginner. 
I will try to make it simple and the purpose is using easyYUI to easily create some demo page or samll website.
This project will not support compilcated website but it will give you a simple UI.

Whole program must be easy!
